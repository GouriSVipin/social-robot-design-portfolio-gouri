  <h1>Scenario-Based Design for Human-Robot Interaction</h1>

  <h2>Design Tool</h2>
  <p>
    The scenario-based design tool developed for this project supports structured creation of speculative yet grounded human-robot interactions. Inspired by speculative design and design fiction methodologies (Dunne & Raby, 2013; Bleecker, 2009), it enables teams to explore ethical, emotional, and contextual dimensions of robot integration in everyday life.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our tool includes a worksheet and card-based prompts built around five design dimensions:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Human Persona:</strong> age, context, vulnerability, attitude toward technology</li>
    <li><strong>Robot Role:</strong> support agent, boundary enforcer, companion, observer</li>
    <li><strong>Setting:</strong> home, care facility, public transit, outdoor event</li>
    <li><strong>Emotional Tone:</strong> trust, anxiety, resistance, comfort, dependence</li>
    <li><strong>Conflict or Tension:</strong> autonomy, dignity, privacy, disagreement</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This tool is informed by Sengers & Gaver’s work on ambiguity in design (2006), Breazeal et al.'s 21st Century Robot framework (MIT Media Lab), and care-centered design principles from Van Wynsberghe (2016). Resources used include <em>Design Noir</em>, ROSY consumer story archives, and HRI case libraries. Visual design files and templates are included in the shared drive. Pictures and interaction flows can be found in the “Tool-in-Use” section of this portfolio.

  <h2>Generated Scenarios</h2>

  <h3>Light Scenario</h3>
  <div class="scenario">
    <strong>Title:</strong> Morning Ease<br>
    <strong>Setting:</strong> Home bedroom<br>
    <strong>Scene:</strong> Ms. Noor wakes up. The bedroom light fades in softly. ROSE, a wellness robot, speaks gently: “Good morning, Noor. Would you like to start with your sleep report or listen to your morning playlist?”<br>
    <strong>Response:</strong> “Let’s do the playlist,” she says, stretching. The robot plays soft acoustic music and gradually opens the blinds.<br>
    <strong>Theme:</strong> Comfort through personalization and low-intrusion interaction.
  </div>

  <h3>Dark Scenario</h3>
  <div class="scenario">
    <strong>Title:</strong> Crossing the Line<br>
    <strong>Setting:</strong> Assisted-living dining area<br>
    <strong>Scene:</strong> Mr. Janssen requests a glass of red wine with dinner. ROSE, monitoring dietary restrictions, replies, “Your health settings don’t allow for alcohol today. I’m afraid I must decline.”<br>
    <strong>Response:</strong> “That’s not your decision to make,” he retorts. He pushes the chair back, visibly irritated.<br>
    <strong>Theme:</strong> Conflict between programmed care ethics and perceived personal freedom.
  </div>

  <h2>Reflections</h2>

  <h3>Sci-Fi Prototyping</h3>
  <p>
     Sci-fi prototyping helped us think beyond current technical limitations. Instead of asking "What can robots do today?", it pushed us to ask "What might they do—and how would that feel?" That shift was important when writing scenarios like Mr. Janssen’s, where a robot makes a morally loaded decision. Drawing inspiration from Bleecker (2009), we saw how near-future fiction can surface ethical grey areas that aren’t obvious from a purely functional design perspective. It gave us space to explore the emotional complexity of human-robot interaction in ways a technical prototype alone wouldn’t allow.
  </p>

  <h3>21st Century Robot Project</h3>
  <p>
     One key takeaway from the 21st Century Robot approach is that robots are not just tools, they’re participants in social life. They express things—whether intentionally or not. That helped shape how we designed ROSE: not just as a system that provides reminders or support, but as something that says things with tone, timing, and presence. If a robot interrupts someone’s dinner, that’s not just a feature, it’s a statement. This project helped us be more conscious of that kind of implicit messaging.
  </p>

  <h3>ROSY Consumer Stories</h3>
  <p>
     The ROSY consumer stories were incredibly useful for grounding our scenarios. Reading about real people interacting with robots in healthcare or home environments made it clear how much emotional weight these moments can carry. What stood out most was how easily people feel dismissed or disrespected—even when the robot is technically correct. For example, in Mr. Janssen’s case, we were directly influenced by a story where a user felt “managed” instead of supported. That distinction really matters when trust is on the line.
  </p>

  <h3>Importance of Storytelling for HRI</h3>
  <p>
     Storytelling allowed us to explore and communicate complex human experiences with robots—especially the parts that don’t show up in technical specifications. Through short, focused scenarios, we could reveal tensions like dependency, resistance, and subtle shifts in power. These narratives are useful not just for design teams, but also for getting feedback from people outside robotics. They can immediately respond to a story, even if they don’t know how the robot works. That makes it a powerful tool for inclusive design and reflection.
  </p>

  <h3>Evidence-Based Work vs Robot Stories</h3>
  <p>
     Evidence-based approaches are obviously essential in domains like healthcare—safety, effectiveness, and outcomes need to be measurable. But when it comes to HRI, stories are just as important. People don’t judge robots only on performance; they react to how they’re treated. Whether a robot feels caring, cold, or patronizing can change how it's used or even whether it's accepted at all. Stories give us a way to surface these reactions and test how certain behaviors might play out emotionally, not just functionally. The ideal is to use both: evidence for what works, stories for how it feels.
