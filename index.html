  <h1>Scenario-Based Design for Human-Robot Interaction</h1>

  <h2>Design Tool</h2>
  <p>
    The scenario-based design tool developed for this project uses <strong>storyboarding</strong> as a visual tool to structure and illustrate human-robot interactions. Storyboarding is an effective method for mapping out scenarios, capturing interactions, emotions, and contextual settings in an easy-to-understand format. This approach enables us to explore speculative, yet grounded human-robot interactions that are informed by ethical, emotional, and social dynamics.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our storyboarding tool helps teams visualize the following key dimensions:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Human Persona:</strong> age, context, vulnerability, attitude toward technology</li>
    <li><strong>Robot Role:</strong> support agent, boundary enforcer, companion, observer</li>
    <li><strong>Setting:</strong> home, care facility, public transit, outdoor event</li>
    <li><strong>Emotional Tone:</strong> trust, anxiety, resistance, comfort, dependence</li>
    <li><strong>Conflict or Tension:</strong> autonomy, dignity, privacy, disagreement</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The design tool draws on principles from speculative design and design fiction (Dunne & Raby, 2013; Bleecker, 2009), as well as care-centered design concepts (Van Wynsberghe, 2016). Our process is inspired by Sengers & Gaver’s (2006) focus on ambiguity in design and the importance of social roles in robotics. Resources for this tool include the ROSY consumer stories and HRI case libraries. Visual assets and interaction flows are documented in the shared drive.

  <h2>Generated Scenarios</h2>

  <h3>Light Scenario</h3>
  <div class="scenario">
    <strong>Title:</strong> Morning Ease<br>
    <strong>Setting:</strong> Home bedroom<br>
    <strong>Scene:</strong> Ms. Noor wakes up. The bedroom light fades in softly. ROSE, a wellness robot, speaks gently: “Good morning, Noor. Would you like to start with your sleep report or listen to your morning playlist?”<br>
    <strong>Response:</strong> “Let’s do the playlist,” she says, stretching. The robot plays soft acoustic music and gradually opens the blinds.<br>
    <strong>Theme:</strong> Comfort through personalization and low-intrusion interaction.
  </div>

  <h3>Dark Scenario</h3>
  <div class="scenario">
    <strong>Title:</strong> Crossing the Line<br>
    <strong>Setting:</strong> Assisted-living dining area<br>
    <strong>Scene:</strong> Mr. Janssen requests a glass of red wine with dinner. ROSE, monitoring dietary restrictions, replies, “Your health settings don’t allow for alcohol today. I’m afraid I must decline.”<br>
    <strong>Response:</strong> “That’s not your decision to make,” he retorts. He pushes the chair back, visibly irritated.<br>
    <strong>Theme:</strong> Conflict between programmed care ethics and perceived personal freedom.
