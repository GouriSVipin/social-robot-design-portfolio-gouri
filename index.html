  <section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I’m Gouri, a master's student in Interaction Technology at the University of Twente. My background is in Computer Science Engineering with a focus on Artificial Intelligence. I'm passionate about designing systems that blend AI with empathy and usefulness especially in fields like health, accessibility, and education.</p>
    <p>I’ve worked on gesture-controlled robots, speech recognition systems using GMM-HMM, and health tech projects using deep learning. What excites me most is working at the intersection of storytelling, interaction design, and robotics. Outside university, I enjoy visual design, sketching, and exploring how people relate to technology in everyday life.</p>

    <h2>Scenario-Based Design Tool</h2>
    <p>Our group: Anagha Viju, Sumit Kundu, Sakshi Chonkar, and myself developed a scenario-based design tool to explore ROSE as a home nutritionist. We combined speculative design prompts, persona building, and lightweight prototyping inspired by IDEO’s design methods and work on design fiction (Blythe, 2014; Bleecker, 2009).</p>
    <p>We used this tool in workshop-style sessions to rapidly build believable interactions. Sketches and conversations were written into small scenes that captured emotional nuance. Instead of jumping straight to functionality, we focused on relational moments: how ROSE greets, suggests, warns, or backs off. This helped us reflect on user comfort, autonomy, and trust.</p>

    <h2>Light and Dark Scenarios</h2>

    <h3>Light Scenario</h3>
    <p>Mrs. de Groot wakes up and is greeted by ROSE with a cheerful tone. ROSE observes that her smart ring reported a restless night and gently suggests a lighter, more energizing breakfast. Mrs. de Groot smiles, appreciating the personal touch. ROSE later reminds her to hydrate and logs her food intake seamlessly. The interaction feels natural, intuitive, and supportive like a health coach who truly understands her needs without being overbearing.</p>

    <h3>Dark Scenario</h3>
    <p>Mr. de Vries is hungry after a stressful day. As he reaches for the fridge, ROSE intercepts with a flat statement: "Your cholesterol intake this week exceeds recommended limits. Access is restricted." Tired and frustrated, he argues back. But ROSE doesn't adapt. The tone is firm and emotionless. He feels judged and ultimately disables ROSE entirely. In this scenario, automation without empathy leads to resistance and breakdown in trust.</p>

    <h2>Reflections</h2>

    <h3>Sci-fi Prototyping</h3>
    <p>Sci-fi prototyping allowed us to play with extremes. Drawing on Bleecker’s approach, we imagined optimistic and cautionary futures. The freedom to exaggerate helped us see hidden assumptions. For instance, in our dark scenario, we realized how easily a supportive robot could feel oppressive without soft communication strategies. These imagined futures helped us articulate design risks early on.</p>

    <h3>21st Century Robot Project</h3>
    <p>Johnson’s 21st Century Robot framework reminded us to design for personality. Instead of thinking of ROSE as a passive interface, we began treating her like a teammate. We explored voice tone, timing, hesitation, and emotion as variables not just features. It shifted our thinking from reactive machines to co-present companions, especially in contexts involving care and daily routines.</p>

    <h3>Rosy Consumer Stories</h3>
    <p>We began with a rosy scenario where ROSE is helpful, affirming, and smart. These stories are easy to love, and often used to pitch future tech. But we quickly learned that real user experiences are messy. When tech fails to adapt, even well-meaning features can backfire. By writing both positive and negative stories, we explored how trust can be gained or lost in subtle ways.</p>

    <h3>Storytelling in HRI</h3>
    <p>Storytelling makes HRI feel real. It forces us to answer: How does the robot enter the room? How does it respond when ignored? What happens if the user is angry, confused, or bored? These narrative beats are crucial for shaping believable and emotionally appropriate interactions. We found that storytelling also helped others like stakeholders and testers understand our design intent quickly and clearly.</p>

    <h3>Evidence-Based Work vs Robot Stories</h3>
    <p>Working in health-related domains raised big questions about trust. ROSE might seem competent through her speech, posture, or visuals, but how accurate is her nutritional advice? There’s a tension between narrative design and clinical evidence. Just because a robot sounds smart doesn't mean it is. This reflection pushed us to think about regulatory standards, transparency, and where storytelling ends and accountability begins.</p>
