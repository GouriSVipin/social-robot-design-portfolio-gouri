    <h2>Case Description: ROSE the Care Robot</h2>
    <p>ROSE, developed by Heemskerk Innovative Technology, is a care robot used in elderly care homes. It supports both nursing and nutrition-related tasks: monitoring vital signs, tracking meals, reminding residents to take medication, and offering social interaction. ROSE helps reduce the workload of staff and improves the consistency of care delivery.</p>

    <h2>Design Tools</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Scenario-Based Tool:</strong> Mind Map → Storyboard → Scratch prototype</li>
      <li><strong>Expression-Based Tool:</strong> Uses color + sound to communicate clearly, including for users with impairments</li>
      <li><strong>Embodiment-Based Tool:</strong> Card game for designing physical robot appearance</li>
      <li><strong>Behavior-Based Tool:</strong> Behavior Tree with Context Swap for failure-testing</li>
      <li><strong>Ethics-Based Tool:</strong> Mini Ethics Canvas for team-wide ethical consideration</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Mind Map of Problem Space</h3>

    <h3>Functional Breakdown</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Vital Monitoring</li>
      <li>Nutrition Analysis</li>
      <li>Medication Reminder</li>
      <li>Social Interaction</li>
      <li>Caregiver Support</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Experimental Approach</h3>
    <p>Simulate elderly interaction scenarios, introduce failure cases in Scratch prototypes, evaluate feedback and adjust accordingly.</p>

    <h2>Reflections</h2>

    <h3>Design Research & HRI</h3>
    <p>Social robot design deeply aligns with HRI principles — scenario-building, embodiment and behavior mapping directly enhance interactive experiences.</p>

    <h3>Digital (AI) vs Embodiment</h3>
    <p>Embodiment strengthens emotional connection, trust, and perceived intelligence—more than voice-only assistants can achieve.</p>

    <h3>Why is 'HER' (not) a Compelling Argument?</h3>
    <p>While ‘HER’ shows emotional bonds with AI, it lacks the complexities of physical interaction and social context inherent in HRI.</p>

    <h3>Robot Revolution — When?</h3>
    <p>We are in a slow, silent revolution — care robots, warehouse bots, and home assistants are already shaping new norms.</p>

    <h3>Dinosaur Hotel (Henn-na Hotel)</h3>
    <p>The Japanese robot hotel failed because robots couldn't adapt to real-time guest needs — showing limits of static automation.</p>

    <h3>Nabaztag</h3>
    <p>Although simple, this WiFi rabbit robot pioneered ambient communication. Its failure shows the need for deeper usefulness and interaction.</p>

    <h3>CuddleBits</h3>
    <p>Minimal, emotional robots are powerful — showing how simplicity can outperform complexity when designed well.</p>

    <h3>Be Right Back..</h3>
    <p>Social robots cannot fully substitute human presence, but can bridge emotional and functional gaps in short spans.</p>
