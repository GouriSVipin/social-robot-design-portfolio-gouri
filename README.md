## 📖 About Me

Hello! I'm **Gouri S Vipin**, a Master I-Tech student at University of Twente.  
I am passionate about AI, robotics, web development, and design. My experience includes developing gesture-controlled robots, deep learning projects in health diagnostics, and a speech recognition system using GMM-HMM models.  
I also enjoy sketching, motion graphics, and volunteer work. My skillset includes Python, SQL, MongoDB, HTML, Figma, AutoCAD, Blender, and ML/DL tools.

## 🛠️ Scenario-Based Design Tool

We used a **scenario-based design approach** to explore ROSE as a **personal nutritionist robot** for home use.  
Our tool is inspired by:
- **User Innovation Toolbox** for random creative constraints
- **Design Fiction and Storytelling** frameworks (Bleecker, 2009; Blythe, 2014)
- **Persona-based and speculative scenario writing**

### 📎 Resources Used:
- Blythe, M. (2014). *Research through design fiction*. CHI.
- Bleecker, J. (2009). *Design Fiction: A Short Essay on Design, Science, Fact and Fiction*.
- IDEO. (2003). *Human-Centered Design Toolkit*.

### 🧰 Design Artifacts:
- Story cards with "What-if" prompts
- Behavior mapping templates for ROSE
- Persona sheets
- Hand-drawn and digital sketches

## 💡 Scenarios

### ✨ Light Scenario
> *Mrs. de Groot wakes up. ROSE greets her with a warm tone and says, “You didn’t sleep well — would you like a lighter breakfast today?” She agrees. ROSE updates her meal plan and checks in again before lunch, offering hydration tips.*

### 🕶️ Dark Scenario
> *Mr. de Vries approaches the fridge. ROSE blocks access, alerting him that his cholesterol levels are over limit. He becomes frustrated. ROSE activates "lockdown mode" to restrict food intake. The interaction ends with Mr. de Vries forcibly turning ROSE off.*

## ✍️ Reflective Questions

### 📚 Sci-fi Prototyping  
Sci-fi prototyping allows us to explore not just what *can* be built, but *what should* be built. Inspired by Bleecker (2009), our dark scenario emerged from asking “what if the robot overreaches?” This exposed ethical tensions in health-monitoring automation that linear design would miss.

### 🤖 21st Century Robot Project  
This project helped us treat ROSE not as a tool, but as a **narrative agent** with values, voice, and agency. Following Brian David Johnson's ideas, we gave ROSE subtle personality traits that made user interaction more human-like and trust-driven.

### 🌷 Rosy Consumer Stories  
Our “light” scenario used optimistic framing to promote a caring, helpful assistant robot. This narrative style can build acceptance and trust but risks masking deeper ethical issues, as seen in over-optimistic portrayals of AI in marketing.

### 🎭 Importance of Storytelling in HRI  
Storytelling makes interaction **legible** — not just for users, but also for designers and stakeholders. It brings out user emotion, pacing, and context, which are critical for **human-robot trust**. Without narrative tools, much of the interaction logic would remain invisible.

### ⚖️ Evidence-Based Work vs Robot Stories  
In health tech, clinical validation is critical. Robots like ROSE, however, often gain trust through **perceived competence** — e.g., appearance, tone of voice, or wearing a lab coat. Designers must balance storytelling with **evidence-based design** to avoid misleading user trust.
